- source_sentence: Are there any ADGM-specific guidelines or best practices for integrating
    anti-money laundering (AML) compliance into our technology and financial systems
    to manage operational risks effectively?
  sentences:
  - 42) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS . Material Exploration and drilling results Rule 12.5.1
    sets out the reporting requirements relevant to disclosures of material Exploration
    and drilling results in relation to Petroleum Resources. Such disclosures should
    be presented in a factual and balanced manner, and contain sufficient information
    to allow investors and their advisers to make an informed judgement of its materiality.
    Care needs to be taken to ensure that a disclosure does not suggest, without reasonable
    grounds, that commercially recoverable or potentially recoverable quantities of
    Petroleum have been discovered, in the absence of determining and disclosing estimates
    of Petroleum Resources in accordance with Chapter 12 and the PRMS.
  - 55) DIGITAL SECURITIES SETTLEMENT Digital Settlement Facilities (DSFs) For the
    purposes of this Guidance and distinct from RCHs, the FSRA will consider DSFs
    suitable for the purposes of settlement (MIR Rule 3.8) and custody (MIR Rule 2.10)
    of Digital Securities. A DSF, holding an FSP for Providing Custody, may provide
    custody and settlement services in Digital Securities for RIEs and MTFs (as applicable).
    Therefore, for the purposes of custody and settlement of Digital Securities, the
    arrangements that a RIE or MTF would normally have in place with a RCH can be
    replaced with arrangements provided by a DSF, provided that certain requirements,
    as described in this section, are met.
  - Part 6.Chapter 3.59.(1) The Regulator shall have the power to require an Institution
    in Resolution, or any of its Group Entities, to provide any services or facilities
    (excluding any financial support) that are necessary to enable the Recipient to
    operate the transferred business effectively, including where the Institution
    under Resolution or relevant Group Entity has entered into Insolvency Proceedings.
- source_sentence: Can you provide further clarification on the specific measures
    deemed adequate for handling conflicts of interest related to the provision and
    management of credit within an Authorised Person's organization?
  sentences:
  - Part 19.Chapter 2.233.(3) If the Regulator considers that an auditor or actuary
    has committed a contravention of these Regulations, it may disqualify the auditor
    or actuary from being the auditor of, or (as the case may be), from acting as
    an actuary for, any Authorised Person, Recognised Body or Reporting Entity or
    any particular class thereof.
  - '43) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES
    IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of
    Terrorism In order to develop a robust and sustainable regulatory framework for
    Virtual Assets, FSRA is of the view that a comprehensive application of its AML/CFT
    framework should be in place, including full compliance with, among other things,
    the: a) UAE AML/CFT Federal Laws, including the UAE Cabinet Resolution No. (10)
    of 2019 Concerning the Executive Regulation of the Federal Law No. 20 of 2018
    concerning Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorism Financing; b) UAE Cabinet
    Resolution 20 of 2019 concerning the procedures of dealing with those listed under
    the UN sanctions list and UAE/local terrorist lists issued by the Cabinet, including
    the FSRA AML and Sanctions Rules and Guidance (“AML Rules”) or such other AML
    rules as may be applicable in ADGM from time to time; and c) adoption of international
    best practices (including the FATF Recommendations).'
  - 4.4.2.(4) An Authorised Person with one or more branches outside the ADGM must
    implement and maintain Credit Risk policies adapted to each local market and its
    regulatory conditions.
- source_sentence: How does the ADGM enforce the Market Abuse Provisions, such as
    those outlined in section 92 of the FSMR, especially for Accepted Spot Commodities,
    and what are the reporting obligations for companies in relation to market abuse
    and transaction reporting?
  sentences:
  - 6.2.6.(b) If appointed, the Trustee must also take reasonable steps to ensure
    that its Employees comply with IFR 6.2.6(a) (i)- (iv).
  - '8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.9. When employing an eKYC System to assist with CDD, a
    Relevant Person should: a. ensure that it has a thorough understanding of the
    eKYC System itself and the risks of eKYC, including those outlined by relevant
    guidance from FATF and other international standard setting bodies; b. comply
    with all the Rules of the Regulator relevant to eKYC including, but not limited
    to, applicable requirements regarding the business risk assessment, as per Rule
    6.1, and outsourcing, as per Rule 9.3; c. combine eKYC with transaction monitoring,
    anti-fraud and cyber-security measures to support a wider framework preventing
    applicable Financial Crime; and d. take appropriate steps to identify, assess
    and mitigate the risk of the eKYC system being misused for the purposes of Financial
    Crime.'
  - 81) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES Market Abuse and Transaction
    Reporting (FSMR) Importantly, the Market Abuse Provisions (including section 92)
    in Part 8 of FSMR specifically cover Market Abuse Behaviour in relation to Accepted
    Spot Commodities admitted to trading on an RIE, MTF or OTF. In this regard, the
    FSRA imposes the same high regulatory standards to Accepted Spot Commodities traded
    on RIEs, MTFs or OTFs as it does to Financial Instruments traded on RIEs, MTFs
    or OTFs.
- source_sentence: Can the ADGM provide examples of legal risks associated with securitisation
    that Authorised Persons should particularly be aware of and manage?
  sentences:
  - 6.Introduction.Guidance.1. This Chapter includes the detailed Rules and associated
    guidance in respect of a firm's obligation to manage effectively its Exposures
    to Operational Risk. Operational Risk refers to the risk of incurring losses due
    to the failure of systems, processes, and personnel to perform expected tasks.
    Operational Risk losses also include losses arising out of legal risk. This Chapter
    aims to ensure that an Authorised Person has a robust Operational Risk management
    framework commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of its operations
    and that it holds sufficient regulatory capital against Operational Risk Exposures.
  - APP4.A4.3.19 Own estimate haircuts . If an Authorised Person fails to comply with
    Rule A4.3.18, the Regulator may revoke its approval for the Authorised Person
    to use own estimate haircuts. The Authorised Person may also be required to revise
    its estimates for the purpose of calculating regulatory Capital Requirements if
    its estimates of E*, does not adequately reflect its Exposure to Counterparty
    Credit Risk.
  - 2.5.6 Financial risk . All applicants are required to demonstrate they have a
    sound initial capital base and funding and must be able to meet the relevant prudential
    requirements of ADGM legislation, on an ongoing basis. This includes holding enough
    capital resources to cover expenses even if expected revenue takes time to materialise.
    Start-ups can encounter greater financial risks as they seek to establish and
    grow a new business.
- source_sentence: Could you provide detailed guidance on the acceptable threshold
    for "significant loss" to clients in the context of IT infrastructure resilience
    for virtual asset service providers?
  sentences:
  - APP8.A8.11.1 An Insurer must calculate the asset management risk component in
    respect of a Long Term Insurance Fund according to the method set out in Rule
    A4.13, applied as though all references in that Rule to an Insurer were instead
    references to that fund.
  - '60) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES
    IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS Security measures and procedures IT infrastructures
    should be strong enough to resist, without significant loss to Clients, a number
    of scenarios, including but not limited to: accidental destruction or breach of
    data, collusion or leakage of information by employees/former employees, successful
    hack of a cryptographic and hardware security module or server, or access by hackers
    of any single set of encryption/decryption keys that could result in a complete
    system breach.'
  - APP4.A4.3.17.(2) An Authorised Person must not use own estimate haircuts unless
    it has received approval to adopt the internal models approach to calculate the
    Market Risk Capital Requirement.
