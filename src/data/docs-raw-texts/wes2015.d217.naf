  <raw><![CDATA[“Don’t be evil” – Google celebrates its 14th Birthday.

Google Logo from 1998.  On September 27, 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google and began their work in the garage of businesswoman Susan Wojcicki. Up to this day, the company has become one of the most powerful in the field of search, cloud computing, productivity software, and advertising, running more than one million servers world wide. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who met at Stanford University began working together on BackRub, a search engine that was not suitable to the University, because of it taking up too much bandwidth. They soon decided to found a new company and came up with the name Google, originating in the word ‘googol’, a mathematical term. It reflected their aim to organize an infinite amount of information on the web. With the financial support by Andy Bechtolsheim and the working space in Susan Wojcicki‘s garage, they could hire their first employee and immediately began growing tremendously, building up a great reputation in Silicon Valley and beyond. PageRank was one of the first technologies, developed at Google. It was the first technology ranking websites based on the relationships to each other instead of counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, which most search engines did back then. Google soon succeeded with their technology, allowing them to offer further services like mail, cloud computing, social media platforms or advertising. However, Google‘s search engine stays the companies oldest and probably most successful features, dominating the market in search engines and ranked as the most visited website in history.

But besides the many opponents, Google has accumulated through the years, they are still able to fascinate and entertain the users in many ways. Google is known for its many creative Doodles or the yearly April Fool Jokes like the announcement of the Internet service TiSP (Toilet Internet Service Provider). Also the company is known for its special methods to motivating their employees. For instance, every new employee is called ‘Noogler’ and has to wear a propeller beanie cap in Google colors on their first Friday. Also the employees are able to use the company’s gym, play billiards or enjoy Google‘s health care plan. Presumably this is why the company is in the list of ideal employers, published by Universum in 2011.
