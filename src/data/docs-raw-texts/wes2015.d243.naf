  <raw><![CDATA[Johannes Hevelius and his Selenographia.

Map of the Moon engraved by astronomer Johannes Hevelius.  On January 28, 1611, German astronomer Johannes Hevelius was born. From four years’ telescopic study of the Moon, using telescopes of long focal power, Hevelius compiled Selenographia (“Pictures of the Moon”, 1647), an atlas of the Moon with some of the earliest detailed maps. Johannes Hevelius‘ father was a succesful merchant and pushed Johannes to follow his footsteps rather than pursue a scientific career. Hevelius was sent to Poland in order to study Polish. At the age of about 16, Hevelius begged his father to be able to continue a formal education and after he finally gave in, Hevelius fell in love with mathematics and astronomy. The young man also learned Latin and began drawing, engraving , and building instruments of wood and metal. His mentor was Peter Crüger, a reknowned mathematician, astronomer, and polymath, who encouraged Johannes Hevelius to take an active part in his observations.

He undertook the necessary studies of the customs and laws of the city and settled down to pursue a career as a businessman. The turning point came around 1639, when Johannes Hevelius visited his old mentor Crüger, who deeply advised his best student not to give up astronomy. Also, Hevelius was again motivated to study his beloved astronomy after he observed an eclipse of the sun which occurred on 1 June 1639. The now married man Hevelius spent every second of his leisure time with astronomy while his wife, Katharina, agreed to take over much of the administrative work associated with the family’s brewery. He started again to grind lenses for telescopes and making mounts for quadrants and sextants. Hevelius also corresponded much with the European leaders of astronomy. [2] Hevelius’ famous text Selenographia was published in 1647 and included 60 drawings of the moon’s surface. For his accomplishment, Hevelius was praised all over Europe, and his maps were considered the best for over a century. Once, English traveler Mundy is believed to have written in his diary: Of the Moone he hath Made above 30 large mappes, prints, or Copper peeces of the Manner of every daies encrease and decrease, deciphering in her land and sea, Mountaines, valleies, Ilands, lakes, etts., making in another little world, giving Names to every part, as wee in a mappe of our world. After the tragic death of his wife, Johannes Hevelius married Catherina Elisabetha Koopman, who was deeply interested in astronomy and contributed to Hevelius’ studies with mathematical calculations and observations. He was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1664. In 1679, Hevelius faced another tragedy. During a fire, his observatory, as well as his instruments and books were completely destroyed. However, the old man apparently did not even think of giving up, but promptly began to repair the damage, being able to observe the Great Comet of 1680. Johannes Hevelius passed away on January 28, 1687.
