On March 19, 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, which connects the Sydney central business district and the North Shore. It is the sixth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world, and it is the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m from top to water level. The first proposals to building a bridge from the northern to the southern shore of the harbour were made in 1815 by Francis Greenway. He wrote a letter to the then “The Australian” newspaper stating that such a bridge would “give an idea of strength and magnificence that would reflect credit and glory on the colony and the Mother Country” ten years later. However, nothing happened. Several years later, in 1840 naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built. Only in 1900 the government organised a worldwide competition for the design and construction of a harbour bridge and the first submissions arrived. Unfortunately, all submissions were considered unsuitable and so the momentum for the bridge crossing stopped. After World War I, the plans got more serious. The New South Wales Government then invited worldwide tenders for the construction of the Bridge in 1922 and the contract was given to the English firm Dorman Long and Co of Middlesbrough. The construction work began in 1924 and took 1.400 men eight years to build. On this day, the bridge carries eight traffic lanes and two rail lines. For the opening of the bridge on March 19, 1932, John ‘Jack’ T. Lang was chosen to cut the ribbon to signify the opening of the Harbour Bridge. Then, Captain Francis De Groot of the political group The New Guard slashed the ribbon with his sword. Captain De Goot believed that the only person to open the Bridge should be a member of the Royal Family. Captain De Goot was detained, the ribbon tied together, and the Premier then officially cut the ribbon. It has been reported that in the 1940s, many pilots flew under the bridge with their planes including the Flight Lieutenant Peter Isaacson during tour around Australia to raise funds for the war effort. The famous Bridge Climb started in 1998. It attracts tourists as well as locals as the view is supposed to be breathtaking. Several celebrities are reported to have climbed Sydney’s Harbour Bridge including Prince Frederik and Princess Mary of Denmark, Matt Damon, Hugo Weaving, Sarah Ferguson, Cathy Freeman, Kylie Minogue and Kostya Tszyu.
