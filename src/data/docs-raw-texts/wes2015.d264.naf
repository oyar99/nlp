  <raw><![CDATA[Giovanni Battista Morgagni and the Science of Anatomy.

Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682 – 1771).  On February 25, 1682, Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni was born. His works helped to make anatomy an exact science. Thus, he often is celebrated as the father of modern anatomical pathology. Giovanni Battista Morgagni was born at Forli, in the Romagna and received a decent scientific education from early years. Already at the age of 14, Morgagni managed to read verses of his compositions and take part in debating philosophical questions at the local academy. He enrolled at the University of Bologna at the age of 16 and earned his Doctor’s degree in philosophy and medicine around 1701. Although Morgagni never confined his scientific interest to medicine, his first chosen field of work was anatomy. He made his first publishment in 1706, titled ‘Adversaria Anatomica Prima‘. It contained new discoveries in anatomy and corrections of many errors of previous writers. The scientist then spent some time to research at Padua and Venice before being appointed professor of Theoretical Medicine at Padua. He was appointed Chair of Anatomy three years later. To one of his major works belongs ‘De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis‘ (Of the seats and causes of diseases investigated through anatomy), published in Venice in 1761. The work was published in five books printed as two folio volumes, which was reprinted several times: in its original Latin, French, English, and German. In it, Morgagni layed the foundations for pathological anatomy. He described the changes from regular condition found in the body after death from diseases of various kinds and also traced the connection between the lesions and the symptoms observed during life. Next to his works on medical science, Morgagni als published papers in archaeology, history, geography, and philology. Throughout his life and beyond, Giovanni Battista Morgagni received numerous academic dignities across Europe. His native town even placed a marble bust of him in its Council Hall during his lifetime, with an inscription describing him as “primus in humani corporis historid”.
